# Test Mod

Test Mod Please Ignore, a mod that I made for forge 1.14.4.

If you want the latest release (if and when it exists) please go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Adrakaris/testmod-forgemc/releases) tab.

For the wiki on all the blocks and items in the mod, as well as their crafting recipes, head on over to the [Wiki](https://github.com/Adrakaris/testmod-forgemc/wiki) tab.

If you find any issues or bugs please bang an issue on the [tracker](https://github.com/Adrakaris/testmod-forgemc/issues) and I'll get to them eventually.
